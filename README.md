# About

This code represents the backend logic for a shoe size converter tool used in a larger application.

The functions in this application (written in both Javascript and Python per client request) allow the programer to convert shoe sizes by Category (Women's, Men's, Infants, etc) and Location (US, Europe, etc) or just simple Inches to Centimeters.

This code covered 465 shoe sizes.

## Start

run `python3 -m venv venv`

## Test Suite

Open virtual env with `source venv/Scripts/activate`

To run python test suite, `cd` into `/python_version` and run `pytest --spec test.py`.

To run javascript test suite, `cd` into `/js_version` and run `npm run test`.

## Usage

This was requested as an isolated component for a client on Upwork. This was not intended to be used by itself, but rather as a part of a larger application used as a web application. The client requested two versions of hte code, one in Python and one in Javascript.
